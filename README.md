# DESCRIPTION OF TASK LIKE HOW YOU PERFORMED AND WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND PASTE PICTURES OF OUTPUT
1. Device Frame Label
At the top of the wireframe, a label reads “Android Medium - 1”.
This indicates that the design is optimized for medium-sized Android screens (commonly used in responsive or adaptive design).
Figma allows designers to choose device frames to simulate real-device environments.

2. Breadcrumb Navigation
The line “HOME > SHOP > ELECTRONICS > SMARTWATCH” represents breadcrumb navigation.
This helps users understand their location within the app’s hierarchy and allows them to easily go back to previous sections.

3. Product Image Area
A placeholder smartwatch image with “360°” label and a rotate icon suggests the product has a 360-degree view feature.
This is useful for users who want to inspect the product from multiple angles, enhancing user interaction.

4. Product Name and Ratings
Below the image:
A generic placeholder text “Product Name”.
Star ratings (4.8 out of 5, with 326 reviews) are shown, along with a strikethrough on the original price ($58.10), indicating a possible discount.
These elements are essential for building user trust and supporting purchase decisions.

5. Size and Color Selection
The wireframe includes:
A “Select Size” dropdown or label with buttons for sizes: S, M, L, XL.
A “Select Color” option (though colors are not shown in detail here).
This is crucial for user personalization and product variation handling.

6. Action Buttons
Two primary call-to-action (CTA) buttons:
“Add to Cart”
“Buy Now”
“Add to Cart” allows the user to continue shopping, while “Buy Now” redirects to a fast checkout.
These buttons are positioned clearly for maximum visibility and usability.

7. Product Details Tabs
Three tabs are labeled:
Description
Specifications
Reviews
These allow users to switch between different kinds of product information without leaving the screen.

8. Customer Reviews Section
Shows an average rating (4.8) with a bar graph distribution for ratings 5 through 1.
There's a dropdown to sort reviews (e.g., “Sort by Most Recent”), enhancing user control over how they view feedback.
A review snippet with a “Verified Buyer” tag builds credibility.

9. Overall Structure
The layout uses a clear vertical scroll structure suitable for mobile.
Design is clean, minimal, and highly user-focused.
Every key buying decision element is grouped logically and displayed prominently.

Summary
This mobile wireframe in Figma represents a complete product detail page for a smartwatch, with all standard e-commerce UI elements: product visuals, pricing, variations, CTAs, specs, and reviews. It is optimized for usability, mobile viewing, and conversion. Using Figma, this design can be shared, commented on by teammates, iterated in real time, and maintained with version history—creating a robust collaborative design workflow.
